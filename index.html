                                <br>
                                I'm very proud that I've coded a perlin noise generator from scratch, which I've been able to implement biomes, drawn by Levi.

                                <br>
                                I'm currently working on all of the train and track movement.  I'm almost done with it and I'm excited to work on other aspects of the design

                                This project is looking more and more promising every day - sometimes I'll think of all the things I want to add and I get so excited to see what our end product is.  Our team is doing a great job.

                                So far I have worked on some music, specifically the Whistle Song, as well as some art, that being the train tracks, the Logo, and have begun concept art for the robots. I have also done all the work on the design doc, and am currently working on this website. Im feeling very good about our team and the game, and am exited to start working with the new members that we have added this year.

                                So far this year, I have made the train sprites for the game, I am currently working on Turrets, the protagonist, passenger animations and Bossbad. I am really excited to get to work on such an atmospheric game, and I'm excited about all the new help we have found in the making.

                                At this point, I have done the basic art for many of the biomes and resources, as well as some work on the backdrops. I'm feeling pretty good about our progress so far, we've already done so much. definitly going to win.
