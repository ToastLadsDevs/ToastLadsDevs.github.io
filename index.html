                                I'm very proud that I've coded a perlin noise generator from scratch, which I've been able to implement biomes, drawn by Levi.

                                I'm currently working on all of the train and track movement.  I'm almost done with it and I'm excited to work on other aspects of the design

                                This project is looking more and more promising every day - sometimes I'll think of all the things I want to add and I get so excited to see what our end product is.  Our team is doing a great job.

                                So far I have worked on some music, specifically the Whistle Song, as well as some art, that being the train tracks, the Logo, and have begun concept art for the robots. I have also done all the work on the design doc, and am currently working on this website. Im feeling very good about our team and the game, and am exited to start working with the new members that we have added this year.

                                So far this year, I have made the train sprites for the game, I am currently working on Turrets, the protagonist, passenger animations and Bossbad. I am really excited to get to work on such an atmospheric game, and I'm excited about all the new help we have found in the making.

                                At this point, I have done the basic art for many of the biomes and resources, as well as some work on the backdrops. I'm feeling pretty good about our progress so far, we've already done so much. definitly going to win.

This is going really well, but being unable to be at club for the whole time makes me nervous. I really want a customizable player and cool looking cutscenes.

                                I've finsihed pretty much all of the passenger sprites and most of the turret sprites. I'm currently workon in finishing the turrets and then I'm going back to working on the train. I think we've come a long way, but I'm worried won't be able to finish in time. Some things may have to be cut.

                                I have now finished all of the biome songs, as well as 2 more train station battle songs, leaving only 2 more battle songs left to do. Ive also completed all of the clothing items, which took forever to do as there was also sitting and using animations along with the top down view of them.

                                I am currently working on all of the journal pages, both for the story implimentaton and tutorials. There is a lot of work both inside and outside of gamemaker that goes into those.

                                We are definitely very behind, we could definitely use another month, but we have less than half of that. I am worried that we wont be able to get everything done on time.

                                I finished all of the turrets, and all the art I've been assigned. I've also been working with William to get all of the sounds done as well.

                                I am currently lying in wait for the boss battle to be create so I can make animations for it.

                                I'm really stressed about getting the project done on time, and it's making me irritable and impatient. If all the main pieces could be finished I will be extremely relieved.
