                        [M/\RK3T M3T/\L] (Market Metal) describes a world where your home is on wheels, your life is in danger, and your mission is to build the best train you possibly can.  Explore 20 unique biomes - each with unique resources to aid in your progression.  But you're not alone... bots lurk around every corner, threatening not only you, but your train and the passengers inside.  You must find a way to push through barriers and become the best conductor ever to live.
                        <br>
                        We are currently working towards getting [M/\RK3T M3T/\L] prepared for a full Steam release, however there is still much left to do and many new features to add, so it will take some time.

                                So far I have worked on some music, specifically the Whistle Song, as well as some art, that being the train tracks, the Logo, and have begun concept art for the robots. I have also done all the work on the design doc, and am currently working on this website. Im feeling very good about our team and the game, and am exited to start working with the new members that we have added this year.

                                So far this year, I have made the train sprites for the game, I am currently working on Turrets, the protagonist, passenger animations and Bossbad. I am really excited to get to work on such an atmospheric game, and I'm excited about all the new help we have found in the making.

                                In this last month I have made a concept demo for one song, and gotten about halfway done on another. I have also done updating on the design doc, more work on the website, and finished most of the playtest feedback form. I am currently working on finishing the second song.

                                I have finished the passenger walk cycles and sprites for Bossbad and decided the passenger sprites will be the protagonist. I am re-vamping the train sprites, and finishing the passenger walk cycles, I also did a trailer video intro. This is going really well, but being unable to be at club for the whole time makes me nervous. I really want a customizable player and cool looking cutscenes.
